1) on first page load, check for javascript errors
    does song load on window load?
    // PlaylistList.setFirstPlaylist is timeout too short?
2) on change playlist, does load first song in lost? any errors?
    // playlistSelect.addEventListener("change", function() {
      setTimeout(function(){},200)})
      is 200 enough? can I go lower?
