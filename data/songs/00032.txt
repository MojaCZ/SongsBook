[1%*C*Gonna put the world away for a minute
*F*Pretend I don't live in it
*C*Sunshine gonna *G*wash my blues a*C*way*G*
*C*Had sweet love but I lost it
*F*She got too close so I fought it
Now I'm *Am*lost in the *G*world tryin' to *F*find me a *G*better *C*way]

[R%Wishin' I was
*C*Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the *F*blue sky, breeze and it don't seem fair
The only *C*worry in the world is the *G*tide gonna reach my *C*chair*G*
*C*Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never *F*been so happy
Never felt so high
And I *Am*think I might have *G*found me my *F*own kind of *G*para*C*dise]

[2%Wrote a note, said "Be back in a minute"
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody's gonna miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishin' my condition ain't ever gonna go away]

[R%]

[Br%This *Am*champagne shore watchin' *C*over me
It's a *G*sweet sweet life livin' by the *C*salty sea*C7*
*F*One day you can be as *C*lost as me
Change your ge*D*ography and maybe *G*you might be*G F Em Dm*]

[R%]

[R+%*C*Come on in the waters nice
*G*Find yourself a little slice
*C*Grab a backpack of life
You'*Am*ll never know *G*until you try*F*
When you *D*lose yourself
You *G*find a key to para*C*dise]
