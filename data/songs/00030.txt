[1%Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday]

[2%I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?" I say,]

[R%When I see your face (face, face...)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
And when you smile (smile, smile...)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are).
Yeah]

[3%Her lips, her lips I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday]

[4%Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay You know I'll say]

[R%]

[Br%The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)]
