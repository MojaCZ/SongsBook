[1%I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything*G*]

[R%*Am*What have I be*F*come
*C*My sweetest *G*friend
*Am*Everyone I *F*know
Goes a*C*way in the *G*end
And *Am*you could have it *F*all
*G*My empire of dirt
*Am*I will let you *F*down
*G*I will make you hurt]

[2%I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liars chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here]
