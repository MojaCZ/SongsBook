[1%*Am*I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
Traveling *Dm*through this world be*Am*low
There is no sickness, no toil, nor danger
In that *Dm*bright *E*land to which I *Am*go]

[R1%I'm going *F*there to see my *C*Father
And all my *F*loved ones who've gone *E*on*E7*
I'm just *Am*going over Jordan
I'm just *Dm*going *E*over *Am*home]

[2%I know dark clouds will gather 'round me
I know my way is hard and steep
But beauteous fields arise before me
Where God's redeemed, their vigils keep]

[R2% I'm going there to see my Mother
She said she'd meet me when I come
So, I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home
I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home]
