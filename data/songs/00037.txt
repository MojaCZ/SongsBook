[1%When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be]


[2%And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be]

[R1%Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be]

[3%And when the broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be]

[4%For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be]

Whisper words of wisdom, let it be]

There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow, let it be]

Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be]
