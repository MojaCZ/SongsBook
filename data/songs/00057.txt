[R%*G#*You and me we're meant to be
Walking *F#*free in harmo*C#*ny
One fine *G#*day we'll fly away
Don't you know that *F#*Rome wasn't built in a *C#*day, hey hey *G#*hey]

[1%*G#*In this day and *F#*age it's so easy to *G#*stress
*G#*'Cause people are *C#*strange and you can never second *D#*guess
*G#*In order to *F#*love child we got to be *D#*strong
*G#*I'm caught in the *C#*crossfire why can't we get *D#*along]

[2%I'm having a daydream, we're getting somewhere
I'm kissing your lips and running fingers through your hair
I'm as nervous as you 'bout making it right
Though we know we were wrong, we can't give up the fight
Oh no]
