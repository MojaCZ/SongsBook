[chords%*G7 Gm F G7 Gm F Am*]

[1%*Dm*Same bed but it *F*feels just a little bit *Gm*bigger now
*C*Our song on the radio but it don't *F*sound the same*Am*
*Dm*When our friends talk *F*about you, all it does is just *Gm*tear me down
*C*'Cause my heart breaks a little when I *F*hear your name]

[R%It *Am/E*all just sounds like *Dm*ooooo*Am*h…, Mmm, *Bb*too young, too dumb to rea*F/C*lize
That *C*I should've bought you *Bb*flowers, *C*And held your *F*hand
*C*Should've gave you all my *Bb*hours, *C*When I had the *F*chance
*F*Take you to every *Bb*party, 'Cause all you *C*wanted to do was *Dm*dance
*G7*Now my baby's *Bb*dancing, But she's *Bbm*dancing with another *F*man*Bb F Am/E*]

[2%My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, ohh…
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes]

[R%]

[Br%Although it *Bb*hurts
I'll be the *C*first to say that I was *F*wrong*Am/E Dm Dm/C*
Oh, I *G7*know I'm probably much too late
To try and a*Gm*pologize for my mistakes
But I just *C*want you to know]
