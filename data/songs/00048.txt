[1%*D*I once had a girl or should I say, *C*she once *G*had *D*me
*D*She showed me her room, isn't it good, *C*Norweg*G*ian *D*wood?]

[R1%She *Dm*asked me to stay and she told me to sit anyw*G*here
So *D*I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a *Em*chair*A*]

[2%I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said, "it's time for bed"]

[R2%She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath]

[3%And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isn't it good Norwegian wood?]
