[1%Twenty-five years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill
Of hope for a destination]

[2%And I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood
Of man for whatever that mean]

[R%And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs,
"What's going on?!"

And I say, "Hey, hey, hey, hey!" I said, "Hey, what's going on?"
And I say, "Hey, hey, hey, hey!" I said, "Hey, what's going on?"]

[3%And I try, oh, my God, do I try
I try all the time
In this institution
And I pray, oh, my God, do I pray
I pray every single day
For revolution]
