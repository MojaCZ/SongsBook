[1%*G*Starry starry *C*night, *G*paint your palette *Am*blue and grey
*C*Look out on a summer's day, with *D*eyes that know the darkness *G*in my*C* soul*G*.
*G*Shadows on the hills*C*, sketch *G*the trees and the *Am*daffodils
*C*Catch the breeze and the winter chills, in *D*colors on the snowy *G*linen land.]

[R%And now I *Am*understand *D*what you tried to *G*say to me*G/F# Em*
How you suffered for your *Am*sanity, *D*how you tried to set them *Em*free.
They would not listen, *A*they did not *Am*know how, perhaps *D*they'll listen *G*now.*C G*]

[2%Starry starry night, flaming flo'rs that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue.
Colors changing hue, morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain, are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand.]

[R%]

[Br%For they could not love *Am*you, but *D*still your love was *G*true*G/F# Em*
And when no *Am*hope was left in sight on that *Cm*starry starry night.
You *G*took your life as *Dm*lovers often *E7*do
*Am*But I could have told you Vincent, this *C*world was never
meant for one as *D*beautiful as *G*you.]

[3%Starry starry night, portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls with eyes that watch the world and can't forget.
Like the stranger that you've met, the ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose, lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow.]

[End%And now I think I know what you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity, how you tried to set them free.
They would not listen they're not list'ning still
Perhaps they never will.]
